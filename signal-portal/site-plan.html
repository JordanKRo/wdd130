    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Signal Portal aims to provide insights into the network performance across BYUI and the wider Rexburg area. By
      analyzing data on connectivity and speed, the site can help highlight areas that may benefit from network
      improvements or better utilization. This information could support educational and practical use cases by showing
      the current state of Rexburg's network capabilities.</p> <!-- change this -->


    <h3>Audience</h3>
    <p>Anyone interested in network performance will find this data valuable, especially students seeking reliable
      internet access on campus. Signal Portal can guide users to areas more likely to offer stable connectivity,
      enhancing study and work experiences.</p> <!-- change this -->

    <h3>What is signal portal?</h3>
    <p>
      Signal portal is a Study being conducted on the BYUI campus to find area's, times, networks, and devices provide
      the best internet access on campus and out. On Wifi and on Cell networks.
    </p>
    <h3>How does it work?</h3>
    <p>
      Participants start by installing the app on their mobile device. Once configured the app provides network speed
      telemetry to the Signal Portal data base. It's that easy, if data rates or battery is a concern, the app can be
      configured to meter the usage of your battery and cell data. Any contribution no matter the size is valuable to
      the open source database.
