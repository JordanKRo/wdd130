        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <h3>Last Updated: November 7, 2024</h3>
        <p>Signal Portal (“we,” “our,” or “us”) is committed to protecting the privacy of our users. This Privacy Policy
            outlines how we collect, use, and store data collected through our app for the purpose of conducting a local study
            on internet speed and connectivity in the area.</p>
      
          <h3>1. Information We Collect</h3>
          <p>Signal Portal collects the following data automatically and anonymously:</p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Device Information:</strong> This includes diagnostics such as battery level and status, as well as
              network information.</li>
            <li><strong>Network Information:</strong> The app collects the MAC address and host name of Wi-Fi access points
              and cell towers to which the device connects.</li>
            <li><strong>Internet Speed:</strong> We measure upload and download speeds for both Wi-Fi and cellular
              connections.</li>
            <li><strong>Precise Location (GPS):</strong> To generate a geographic heatmap of signal quality, we collect GPS
              coordinates of the device.</li>
          </ul>
      
          <h3>2. How We Use Collected Information</h3>
          <p>The data collected by Signal Portal is used solely for research purposes, specifically to analyze internet speed
            and connectivity patterns in the local area. The data will help us identify trends and create publicly accessible
            maps showing general connectivity information. <br><br><strong>Note:</strong> Publicly accessible data does not include
            MAC addresses or other identifying network information.</p>
      
          <h3>3. Data Anonymization and Security</h3>
          <p>Signal Portal does not collect any personal information, such as names, email addresses, or contact information.
            All data is anonymized before it is stored and analyzed, ensuring individual devices cannot be linked back to
            specific users. We implement strict security measures to protect all data collected from unauthorized access.</p>
      
          <h3>4. Data Retention</h3>
          <p>Collected data is stored only as long as necessary to conduct our research and generate connectivity reports.
            Data will be deleted when it is no longer required.</p>
